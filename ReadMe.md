ERC721: This is a standard for creating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital items like collectibles, real estate, or art.

Ownable: This provides basic ownership functionality, meaning it lets you control who can do certain things in the contract.

URI:  A URI is like a web link to information about the token (like a description, images, etc.).

ERC721("RealEstateNFT", "REALESTATE"): This initializes the parent contract with a name ("RealEstateNFT") and a symbol ("REALESTATE").

mint: This function creates a new NFT.
